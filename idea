Truth Tables
  Introduce logical connectives in a progressive way (not, and, or, implies, double implication)
  Let students compute truth tables
  Have students invent propositions having a given truth table

Discussion with Steve on 2020-12-18
===================================

The idea is for this to be a toy for students to play with.  Steve imagines using the toy as follows:

- Select the set of operators to use
- Select the total number of operators to use
- Be able to guess the reduced value of the expression and reveal whether that
  guess is correct
- Be able to step through sequentially simplified versions of the expression

And there's also predicate management:

- Select the size of the universe
- Name some random (i.e. having random values over the universe) predicates and
  indicate if they are one- or two-variable predicates
